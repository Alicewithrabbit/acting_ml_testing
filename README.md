Tests of alternative approaches to success classification using the IMDb data set

Each test is presented in an individual file to keep things seperate.
The null model is also included for comparison purposes.

Note that although some of these models do perform slightly better than the proposed classifier in the paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10213-0), it is not by much. That said, these are all fairly "off the shelf" classifiers.
